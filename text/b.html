Michael Goodrich received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Purdue University
</p>
<p>
in 1987. He is currently a Chancellor¡¯s Professor in the Department of Computer
</p>
<p>
Science at University of California, Irvine. Previously, he was a professor at Johns
</p>
<p>
Hopkins University. He is a Fulbright Scholar and a Fellow of the American As-
</p>
<p>
sociation for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Association for Computing
</p>
<p>
Machinery (ACM), and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
</p>
<p>
He is a recipient of the IEEE Computer Society Technical Achievement Award,

Roberto Tamassia received his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering
</p>
<p>
from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1988. He is the Plastech
</p>
<p>
Professor of Computer Science and the Chair of the Department of Computer Sci-
</p>
<p>
ence at Brown University. He is also the Director of Brown¡¯s Center for Geometric
</p>
<p>
Computing. Hisresearch interests include information security, cryptography, anal-
</p>
<p>
ysis, design, and implementation of algorithms, graph drawing and computational
</p>
<p>
geometry. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of
</p>

Michael Goldwasser received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford
</p>
<p>
University in 1997. He is currently a Professor in the Department of Mathematics
</p>
<p>
and Computer Science at Saint Louis University and the Director of their Com-
</p>
<p>
puter Science program. Previously, he was a faculty member in the Department
</p>
<p>
of Computer Science at Loyola University Chicago. His research interests focus
</p>
<p>
on the design and implementation of algorithms, having published work involving
</p>
<p>
approximation algorithms, online computation, computational biology, and compu-
</p>
<p>
tational geometry. He is also active in the computer science education community.
